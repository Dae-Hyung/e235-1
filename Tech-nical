The purpose of the Programming Historian Project is to teach users how humanists use a variety of digital tools and research processes.

The audience for the project is students or really anyone trying to learn more into the depths of digital tools used for communication.

I would say this is technical writing because of the extent with the use of technology. This programming historian project is teaching the users how to communicate better using technology which is one of the big parts of technical writing.
